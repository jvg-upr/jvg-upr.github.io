## Who am I?
Hello, My name is Jantony Velazquez Gauthier and I am a Computer Science student in the University of Puerto Rico.
Although I have a wide range of interests, from mathematics to code golf, I'm mainly focused in systems programming.

## Skills
Throughout my 5 years of programming I have become very familiar with:

* Rust
* Scheme: Guile and Racket variants
* C/C++
* Python

As you might infer from my list of known languages, I am fairly well versed with both high-level and low level languages.
I'm also very comfortable with several programming paradigms (procedual, object oriented and functional).

Most of my experience programming has been with small teams, 2 to 5 people. This has led me to develop soft skills in teams
through experiencing and embracing techniques like pair programming. Additionally I have developed a fairly solid understanding 
of git as a VCS.


## Projects
You can take a look at [my github](https://github.com/jvg-upr). Most of my personal projects are written in rust and 
unfortunately what can be seen in my github is only a fraction of what I've done.
